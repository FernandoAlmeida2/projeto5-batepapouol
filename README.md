# projeto5-batepapouol


This project is an implementation of an old version of UOL Chat. Initially, there is a layout where the user enters a name; if there is no one with that name,
the application then displays the chat interface. There is a top-right icon that displays a hidden lateral bar with the list of online users. In that bar, the user can also choose the privacy settings as well as the user to whom he wants to send a private message. Every 10 seconds, the list is refreshed. The main chat is refreshed every 3 seconds. To keep the user connected, it was necessary to send a request every 5 seconds, otherwise the user is disconnected from the chat and the page is refreshed. There are 3 possibilities for messages: private, status, and public messages, each with its own style. The scroll automatically goes to the end of the message box when new messages are displayed.

It's the first time I've worked on API's and JavaScript, requesting and sending information from a server. It was challenging but exciting to implement all the features.


It's a project for bootcamp training, so the purpose is exclusively to learn and gain experience. The most challenging part for me was to make the lateral bar of active users in all its details.
